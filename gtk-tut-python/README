This should be sufficient to create pretty good fingerprint reader gui
as well as map a few upcoming projects such as converting existing code
to gtk3 code. The tutorial itself implements deprecation warning system and 
lazy name spaces so the code I have here had been caught by deprecation 
warning and had been rewritten or in the process of being rewritten using
recommended widget.
